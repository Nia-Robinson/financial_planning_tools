# Project Title: Financial Planning Tools

This is a Jupyter notebook that contains the code for a financial planner for emergencies, and a financial planner for retirement using the Monte Carlo simulation.

Dataset:
---
SAMPLE.env

Final Analysis:
---
When analyzing the performance of the emergency fund (three times the monthly income), there was enough funds in the combined portfolio including cryptocurrency, stocks, and bonds.



When analyzing the performance of the 30-year retirement planner, the stock was weighted by 60%, the bond was weighted by 40%. There is a 95% chance that an initial investment of $10,000 in the portfolio over the next 30 years will end within the range of $26159.33 and $411248.43.

When analyzing the performance of the 10-year retirement planner, the stock was weighted by 80%, the bond was weighted by 20%. There is a 95% chance that an initial investment of $10,000 in the portfolio over the next 10 years will end within the range of $9128.91 and $74273.44.

We can conclude that weighting the portfolio more heavily to stocks allow the credit union members to retire after only 10 years is NOT realistic.
